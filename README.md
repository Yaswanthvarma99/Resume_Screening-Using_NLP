Streamlining Hiring Processes


Used TfidfVectorizer for vectorizing the tokens - TF-IDF
(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vector is a numerical representation of text, emphasizing the importance of terms in a document relative to a corpus.

FOR CLASSIFICATION I USED  KNEIGHBORSCLASSIFIER – 
K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS (KNN) CLASSIFIER IS A MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM THAT CLASSIFIES A DATA POINT BASED ON THE MAJORITY CLASS OF ITS K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS IN THE FEATURE SPACE.
